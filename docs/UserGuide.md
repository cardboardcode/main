## **About**

**_Task Tracker_ (T-T)** is an easy-to-use software which helps you manage your daily tasks. It is a simple and fun product which uses a creative Graphical User Interface to make the operations quick, easy and intuitive.

## **Quick Start**

T-T is a lightweight app which does not require much time to install and run. 

> Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed on your PC.

In order to install T-T, 

1. Download the T-T files from https://github.com/t09-c3/task-tracker
2. Double-click on the T-T.jar file to start the app.<br>

## **Commands**

`<>` _indicates that field is compulsory_ and `[]` _indicates that field is optional._ 

###1. **ADD** a Task

The format for adding a new task is: <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;   `add <task> [date1] [date2] [-h | -m | -l]` <br>


*  T-T can accept flexible date formats. Examples are:
    *  `today`
    *  `monday`(to set the date as next monday)
    *  `31 Oct`
*   If **no date** is specified, the task will be assumed to be a **floating task** which is an action whose deadline is indefinite.
*   You do not need to specify any dates. You can specify only 1 date or 2 dates.
    *   If **1 date** is written, it would be taken as the deadline.
    -   If **2 date** is written, they would be the start and end times for the task.

*   `[-h | -l]` refers to the priority of the task. 
    *   `-h` means **high** priority. 
    *   `-m` means **medium** priority.
    *   `-l` means **low** priority.
    *   If not specified, priority is **medium**.
    *   Except for `<task>`, the other parameters can be inputed in any order.

<br>For example:<br>
*   `•  add wash dishes monday 4pm -h ` will create a high priority `wash dishes` task to be done on the **next Monday**.
*   `•  add call mum tmr ` will create a task named `call mum` to be done anytime on **the next day** with **normal** priority.<br>

###2. EDIT a Task

The format to edit an existing task is : <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; `edit <task index> <new task> [new date1] [new date2] [-h | -m | -l] ` <br>

  * `<task index>` can be obtained from the list panel, or by using the list command (See **List** command).

<br> For example: <br>

Let’s say task index “**1**” refers to the task `wash dishes monday 4pm`

*  `edit 1 wash dishes tuesday 6pm -h` will edit the existing `wash dishes` task to `use dishes` and change the date from **monday** to **tuesday** , time from **4pm** to **6pm** and priority from **medium** to **high**.

###3. DELETE a Task

The format to edit an existing task is : <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; `delete <task index>` <br>

>   *  `<task index>` can be obtained from the list panel, or by using the list 


<br> For example: <br>

Let’s say task index “**1**” refers to the task `wash dishes monday 4pm`

*   `delete 1` will delete the aforementioned `wash dishes` task.

###4. LIST Tasks

The format to edit an existing task is : <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; `list [date | priority]`<br>

>   *   The tasks will be shown based on the parameters specified. If no parameters given, the tasks are organized by date.
>   *   Both date and priority can be specified at the same time.

<br> For example : <br>
`list 9 Oct`  will display all tasks due on 9th October.
`list high` will display all tasks of high priority.
`list` will display all tasks organised by date.
`list high today` will display all tasks of high priority due today.

###5. HELP command

Enter `help` into the command line to list out all the commands available in T-T.<br> <br>

## **T-T List Statistics**

T-T also provides an intuitive listing the number of tasks stored, giving you a clearer idea on how to better deal with them. As seen in **the example below**, the numbers are displayed on the right of the task list. 

T-T's list statistics provides data on all the different types of tasks available in storage:

    -      Today's Tasks 
    -      Tomorrow's Tasks
    -      Event Tasks (Tasks with parameters all filled.)
    -      Deadline Tasks (Tasks which are much due much later)
    -      Floating Tasks (Tasks with incomplete parameters)
